    "## Section 2: Filter Design\n",
    "For EEG data analysis, there are various decisions that need to be made when selecting an appropriate filter. All signals are corrupted by outside noise, and EEG data is particularly susceptible to noise from electronics, muscle movements, and skin conductance changes (sweat). Filtering allows us to get rid of some of the junk, but it is not magic. There is no substitute for collecting clean data. Filtering will also throw out some of the data we care about, but this is a relatively small price to pay. <br><br>\n",
    "When selecting a filter, it is often a good idea to review the relevant literature. <br><br>\n",
    "For this assignment, we will be using a common filter for ERP research known as the Butterworth filter (IIR). Butterworth filters aim to remove (attenuate) frequencies which you are not interested in, while leaving the frequencies you are interested in alone. We will be constructing a Butterworth *bandpass* filter. Bandpass filters allow a certain range (*band*) of frequencies to *pass* through, while other frequencies are attenuated (the opposite of amplified). <br><br>\n",
    "The specifics of filter construction are beyond the scope of this class, but the current filter is designed for offline use. We will show an example of a filter that can be used an in online system in assignment 2.<br><br>\n",
    "We must define the sampling rate, along with the lower and upper thresholds of frequencies to pass, and an order for our filter. We will be choosing **0.1 Hz** as our lowest frequency to pass, and **10 Hz** as our highest frequency to pass. We will investigate the effects of order in this assignment."
